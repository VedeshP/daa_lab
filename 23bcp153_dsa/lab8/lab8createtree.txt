dynamic creation of tree

createtree
enter node value 
scanf
if data = -1
return null
else

ptr = createnode(data)

ptr.left = createtree
ptr.right = createtree
return ptr;

in main call

root = createtree

postorder iterative /w 1 stack and 2 stack

1 stack 
first right child push then root push

when all nodes are done 
print check if node has right child 
if right child and stack top are same then
if it has then get the right child (subtree) - pop it and push the root of it to stack
stop at underflow 
we are checking using these stack whether the right child/subtree is processed or not


2 stack method 

stack 2 - root push
while stack 1 is not empty
push left 1
push right 1

stack 2 pop all
